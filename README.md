`loraxe` is a low-bandwidth layer-7 HTTP DOS tool that handles connections in parallel. __Written with 100% Safe Rust__ 

## üéÅ Features

- Fully Configurable via `structopt`
- Colored logs, via `pretty_env_logger`
- Create/Recreate sockets in parallel via `rayon`
- Low-bandwidth usage
- Built in DNS
- SSL (Coming Soon)

### üñß DOS Modes

- __Slow HTTP (Slowloris)__: Holds connections open by slowly completing the http request after sending a complete header.
- __Slow POST__: Sends a POST request with a content length of `1m` and then sends random data at a rate of 1 byte / <delay>.
- __[WIP] Slow READ__: Requests a file larger than a servers given send buffer (~65Kb - 124Kb) and then reads the result at a user defined rate.


## üì¶ Installation

The installation of `lor-axe` is easy if you have `cargo` installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajmwagar/lor-axe
cd lor-axe

lori 0.0.0.0 -p 8080 -s 200

# Start a HTTP POST attack on 0.0.0.0:80 with 150 concurrent connections
lori 0.0.0.0 --post

# Start a Slow READ attack on 0.0.0.0:80 with 150 concurrent connections and a read buffer of 8 bytes
